    <p>RRB calls applications from the eligible applicants through "Employment News" (A publication of the Government of India) for various Technical and non-technical categories as well as Para medical posts in Group 'C' cadre, as per indent(s) submitted by Chief Personnel Officer of South East Central and Central Railways. The employment notification is also being published on the Internet website (http://www.rrbbilaspur.gov.in/). Indicative notification is also given through prominent National & Local dailies for wide circulation. The applications, as received in response to such notification, are scrutinized for eligibility and the eligible candidates are called for a written examination with call letters being sent a month in advance of the date of the examination. The examinations are generally held in various schools/ colleges/Institutes of Raipur, Bilaspur, Bhilai-Durg and Nagpur cities depending upon the number of candidates.</p>
    <p>If numbers of candidates are large, the candidates who qualify in the preliminary exam are called for the main written exam, and the merit list is prepared based entirely upon the result of the main exam. In most categories of jobs, there is no interview after the written examination. For a very few specific categories there is a viva after the written exam, while for certain other categories there is a skill test like typing test or stenography test. For categories related to operational safety like Assistant Station Master, Assistant Loco Pilot there will be an aptitude test.</p>
    <p>The application details furnished by successful candidates are verified and they are called for counseling and scrutiny of original documents. A panel of names is then recommended to Zonal Railways to the extent of vacancies. The candidates will be required to pass the prescribed medical examination conducted by the Railways before appointment.</p>

       <li>Through the Internet website of this RRB.</li>
       <li>To the successful candidates through registered post.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The selection process is based on merit and is subject to the rules and regulations issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Railways (Railway Board), which includes reservation of jobs for certain castes/communities such as Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Communities (OBC). Ex-servicemen and Persons with disability (PWD).</p>
    <p>The entire recruitment system is computerized and functions impersonally without fear or favour. There is no scope for corruption, influence or discretion in this process. Candidates indulging in malpractices and unfair means are dealt with strictly.</p>
    <h2>Appointments:</h2>
    <p>RRB recommends the name of the candidates and the appointments are made by respective Zonal Railways after following due procedure including medical examination prescribed for the respective category.</p>
